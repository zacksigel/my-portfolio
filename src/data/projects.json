      "overview": "Policygenius debuted a new app that would generate will and trust documents for users. To support its launch, I pitched the idea of surveying 2,000 Policygenius customers on their experiences with and knowledge of estate planning. The result would comprise a fresh dataset to inform the development of the app as well as a white paper to serve as a marketing asset announcing Policygenius’ foray into estate planning.",
      "role": "I tasked my team with writing survey questions, then worked with senior leadership to carry out the survey. I assigned an editor on my team, Elissa Suh, the role of creating new estate planning content and optimizing it for organic channels. I also worked with the social media, media relations, and design teams to support the production and distribution of the white paper. Our content was repurposed as ad copy for the app release, and my team and I also consulted with the engineering team to create in-app UX content."

I also write her monthly newsletter, which now reaches thousands of subscribers. We worked together to define her voice and target specific personas across renters, buyers and sellers. Both the newsletter and website have directly led to new clients and exclusive listings, and Zhou has now been recognized as a top broker in New York by Douglas Elliman."

      "overview": "When I was promoted to managing editor at Policygenius, my first order of business was to create an SEO content strategy around an all-new personal finance vertical. Policygenius is an insurance marketplace, and I realized that we were missing out on millions of potential new customers who were be searching for related financial products and to whom we could cross-sell our insurance products. Therefore, I designed and implemented a content roadmap for subjects like mortgages (for which home insurance is a necessity) and estate planning (a natural extension of life insurance).",
      "role": "As the architect of my team's SEO strategy, I was closely involved at every stage of the process. I performed all of the keyword research, from which I extrapolated our core topics, and created a content calendar to track and prioritize our output. I wrote articles alongside my direct reports as well as edited their work, and I tracked the progress of each article and made updates and revisions as needed to best match search intent. Working with our software engineers, I developed CTAs that linked a related personal finance product back to one of Policygenius's insurance offerings."

      "role": "I assigned and edited all copy written by Silva and optimized it for Google. I worked with the design team to create all visual assets and developed the email series with our CRM team. Silva and I consulted with our social media team to create videos for Instagram. I executed an intra-company campaign to introduce our 800+ colleagues to the Tax Genius ecosystem and solicit questions for the column."

        "overview": "One of my goals was to expand our backlink profile by publishing shareable blog articles optimized for search. To maximize visibility, the release was timed to Tax Day, and it would take a unique position on a contentious subject to attract the broadest possible audience. We workshopped the content until we were certain of its investigational value; it continues to appeal to both sides of the political spectrum to this day. One measure of this article's success: it was shared by both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party on national platforms at the height of the 2020 election season.",
        "role": "I developed a hypothesis to generate buy-in for my pitch: through an SEO strategy built around targeting “highish”-volume long-tail keywords, we could easily take the top spot on Google, and social media users reposting our link would do the rest. I assigned this piece to my taxes editor, Derek Silva, and developed a press campaign strategy with our media relations team."

My original mandate, when I started as senior content marketing manager, was to completely redesign our content strategy to maximize our reach across organic channels. Because M1 had hardly touched SEO as a marketing tool, there was enormous upside in building out all-new evergreen and explainer content that could drive new clients to M1's platform.",
        "role": "I managed a team of two independent contributors as well as freelancers, so the first thing I did was assess each one's capacity for the subjects I wanted to prioritize and target. Then, I built a content calendar using over 2,500 keywords from a range of personal finance topics that we were not ranking for but should. Of those, 400 articles were planned; my direct reports wrote them, and I edited them. In addition, articles were featured in our weekly newsletter, The M1 Mindset, alongside additional news and commentary to support the company's mission."
